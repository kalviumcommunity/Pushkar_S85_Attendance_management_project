## Part 5: Establishing Students, Teaching & Non-Teaching Staff hierarchy
- Created a base class `Person.java` with common attributes (`id`, `name`), a universal auto-ID generator, and a `displayDetails()` method.
- Modified `Student.java` to inherit from `Person`, using `super()` to call the parent constructor and overriding `displayDetails()` to add student-specific info (e.g., grade level).
- Created `Teacher.java` extending `Person`, adding a `subjectTaught` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Created `Staff.java` extending `Person`, adding a `role` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Demonstrated creation and display of `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Staff` objects in `Main.java`.
- Updated `AttendanceRecord` creation to use the inherited `getId()` method.
